Proxmark

 

The Proxmark is an RFID swiss-army tool, allowing for both high and low level interactions with the vast majority of RFID tags and systems world-wide. Originally built by Jonathan Westhues over 10 years ago, the device has progressively evolved into the industry standard tool for RFID Analysis.
Its versatility has seen it adapted to many industries and uses: from RFID enthusiasts, academic research, product development, law enforcement and penetration testing.
There has been a rapid evolution of the hardware and software in the last few years, resulting in mature and minaturised versions of the hardware. There are revisions optimised for in-the-field use, such as red-teaming or pen-testing, and desktop versions tweaked for research use in the office or lab. In September 2021, the "iCopy-X" was released - a completely portable and standalone RFID Cloning device with an embedded Proxmark 3. The iCopy-X is the most versatile Proxmark-powered device to date - a culmination of many efforts to make an electronically stable, physically compact and portable device that is easy to use, while maintaining full control for expert users.



H2 Portapack

 

The PortaPack is an add-on, which attaches to the HackRF and adds a touch-screen LCD, user controls, headphone jack, high-accuracy clock reference, real-time clock, micro SD card slot, and custom aluminum case.
When users attach a USB battery, they‚Äôre ready to explore radio spectrum from just about anywhere.  The PortaPack makes capture and replay of wireless signals like those from ISM band remote controls very easy.
Besides legitimate uses, cyber criminals are known to use the PortaPack HackRF One to perform a wide variety of attacks such as ‚ÄúJamming attacks‚Äù where the attacker emits noise to block the reception of a signal, ‚ÄúReplay attacks‚Äù where a signal is recorded and replayed without the original source device, ‚ÄúGPS spoofing‚Äù or even ‚ÄúSide channel attacks‚Äù that allow an attacker to remotely monitor what is being displayed on a monitor of a victim.
Cybersecurity professionals believe that understanding how cyber criminals use PortaPack HackRF One can help organizations adjust system vulnerabilities to reduce hacking risks.

Flipper Zero

 

Flipper Zero is an electronic tool that has a curious character of a cyber dolphin who really loves to hack. The dolphin grows while you interact with digital systems in real life and he does it in his very own manner. Your actions will build his personality and he will always have fun and comment on them in his unique style.
Flipper was inspired by the pwnagotchi project. However, unlike all the other DIY boards for hackers, it's designed with the convenience of everyday usage in mind. Flipper has a robust case, handy buttons and shape, and none of these dirty PCBs and scratchy pins. Flipper turns pentesting into a game, reminding you that researching always should be fun.
Flipper Zero is completely autonomous ‚Äî it has a beefy battery, a handy 5-position directional pad, and a display. All the main functions and scripts are available from Flipper's menu, no computer or smartphone required. 
For more control, Flipper is equipped with the USB Type-C port for upgrading the firmware, deploying virtual serial port, and emulating HID input device. We have also decided to build in a cool old-school LCD screen, and not fancy TFT / IPS / OLED because it's perfectly visible in sunlight and has an ultra-low 400nA power consumption with the backlight turned off. This allows Flipper Zero to be always on and ready with more than 7 days of battery life.
To communicate with the real world systems, Flipper Zero has a built-in radio module based on TI CC1101 chip. It supports both transmitting and receiving digital signals within the 300-928 MHz frequency range. This is the operating range for a wide class of devices and access control systems such as garage doors remotes, boom barriers, IoT sensors, and remote keyless systems.  


Pwnagotchi

 

Pwnagotchi was created by Evilsocket, a hacker, maker, security researcher, AI and physics nerd that we all love and appreciate.
It's a super cute lil' buddy which eats wifi connections and lives on a small computer which can fit in your pocket.
Pwnagotchi is an "AI" that learns from the WiFi environment and instruments bettercap in order to maximize the WPA key material (any form of handshake that is crackable, including PMKIDs, full and half WPA handshakes) captured.
Get started building one by checking out the official project on GitHub: https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi
Unofficial list of Pwnagotchi builds and parts with notes:
https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnagotchi/comments/11bxv0n/i_created_pwnnotes_a_simple_collaborative/
Pwnagotchi is an A2C-based ‚ÄúAI‚Äù powered by bettercap and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures (either through passive sniffing or by performing deauthentication and association attacks). This material is collected on disk as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by hashcat, including full and half WPA handshakes as well as PMKIDs.
In case you're curious about the name: Pwnagotchi („Éù„Éº„Éä„Ç¥„ÉÉ„ÉÅ) is a portmanteau of pwn and -gotchi. It is a nostalgic reference made in homage to a very popular children's toy from the 1990s called the Tamagotchi. The Tamagotchi („Åü„Åæ„Åî„Å£„Å°, derived from tamago („Åü„Åæ„Åî) "egg" + uotchi („Ç¶„Ç™„ÉÉ„ÉÅ) "watch") is a cultural touchstone for many Millennial hackers as a formative electronic toy from our collective childhoods.

Hack-cat Nugget

 

HakCat provides pre-soldered and pre-flashed nuggets on its web store, but the design is simple enough that you can build it yourself from parts if you‚Äôre so inclined. Just take the Gerber and BOM (Bill of Materials) files from GitHub to your local PCB Manufacturer (PCBWay, OSH Park, and JLCPCB, to name a few) and get a handful of them produced. After that, you just need to order some parts from the internet, do a teensy bit of soldering, 3D print some cases, flash the firmware with ESPTool in Chrome, and you are good to go!
What can it do?
Essentially, it can cause trouble with Wi-Fi networks ‚Äî sending out specific commands that play with the way networks and client devices authenticate each other. In that way, the Nugget shares a lot in common with the DSTIKE watch and can even run a modified version of the same Deauther tool by Spacehuhn ‚Äî but that‚Äôs not the only attack you can try. There‚Äôs also the probe attack, which plays with the initial call-and-response commands, or the beacon attack that lets you spoof an access point. Once you‚Äôve mastered those, the folks at HakCat have built on Spacehuhn‚Äôs original project to create a tool for detecting Wi-Fi

Screen Crab

 
he Screen Crab by Hak5 is a stealthy video man-in-the-middle implant.
This covert inline screen grabber sits between HDMI devices - like a computer and monitor, or console and television - to quietly capture screenshots. Perfect for sysadmins, pentesters and anyone wanting to record what's on a screen.
WiFi enabled to stream screenshots via Hak5 Cloud C2.
The Screen Crab is already setup to save screenshots to a MicroSD card right out of the box. It will also automatically generate a config.txt file with the default settings. Changing these self-explanatory settings is just a matter of editing the text file. What could be easier?
The capture mode can be set to image or video, the capture interval can be set in seconds and the storage options can be set to either stop when the MicroSD card is full, or continuously capture - deleting the oldest file to make room for the newest. Further the LED and Button may be disabled and WiFi can be configured with simple parameters.

O.MG Cable

 
The O.MG Cable is a hand made USB cable with an advanced implant hidden inside. It is designed to allow your Red Team to emulate attack scenarios of sophisticated adversaries. Until now, a cable like this would cost $20,000 (ex: COTTONMOUTH-I). These cables will allow you to test new detection opportunities for your defense teams. They are also extremely impactful tools for teaching and training.

The uncompromising attention to the physical size of the cable isn't where we stopped. Thanks to continual firmware updates, the resulting power, flexibility, and ease of use have made the O.MG Cable a favorite for both new students and seasoned pros.

The O.MG Plug's ease of use and speed make it the perfect DuckyScript‚Ñ¢ tool. Full control over wifi. Just open your web browser. Mobile and desktop supported. Documentation is built in, so it‚Äôs always there when you need it. 
Payloads compile, transfer, and execute automatically with a single click. There is no faster way to do Payload tuning and rapid testing. Save and load multiple payloads to the onboard storage. And, of course, set a payload to execute automatically. Owners of the O.MG Cable will be right at home with the DuckyScript‚Ñ¢ deployment web UI. We use a modified version for the O.MG Plug. 
The Small form factor is great for every day carry on a Keychain or in your pocket. Always have some mischief ready to go, with the O.MG Plug. 
Due to the advanced capabilities of the O.MG Plug, regulations require that they are shipped "deactivated". An O.MG Programmer lets you activate them using an easy 3 step desktop web-browser utility. This will also allow you to upgrade to the latest firmware, recover if you lock yourself out, and just generally make the O.MG Plug impossible to "brick". The O.MG Programmer is universal for all O.MG Devices, so you only need one for all your O.MG Cables, O.MG Adapters, and O.MG Plugs.


Key Croc
 
The Key Croc by Hak5 is a keylogger armed with pentest tools, remote access and payloads that trigger multi-vector attacks when chosen keywords are typed. It's the ultimate key-logging pentest implant.
More than just recording and streaming keystrokes online, it exploits the target with payloads that trigger when keywords of interest are typed.
By emulating trusted devices like serial, storage, HID and Ethernet, it opens multiple attack vectors ‚Äì from keystroke injection to network hijacking.
Imagine capturing credentials and systematically using them to exfiltrate data. Or pentest from anywhere, live in a web browser with Cloud C2.
It's simple too. A hidden button turns it into a flash drive, where changing settings is just editing a text file. And with a root shell your favorite pentest tools like nmap, responder, impacket and metasploit are at the ready.


Wifi Coconut
 
There are 14 channels on the 2.4 GHz WiFi spectrum. Why packet sniff with only one radio?

This handheld device is simple to use and powerful, allowing you to listen and record conversations. Its working principle is very simple, you just need to switch on, plug in headphones, hold microphone to wall and adjust volume. The HY-929 works by amplifying the vibration of sound waves. When people talk, sound waves hit wall causing vibrations, the microphone picks up the vibrations and amplifies them according to volume. The vibration picked up by microphone is amplified 20,000 times to create audible sound. The contact microphone sensor can sense the vibration that hits the wall, ceiling, floor etc and amplify it so that you can hear what is being said. If the sound is low, you adjust volume dial to increase magnification.

Bansenshukai 
 
Bansensh≈´kai (Ëê¨Â∑ùÈõÜÊµ∑, Ten Thousand Rivers Flowing Together to form an Ocean) (Also pronounced Mansenshukai) is a Japanese book containing a collection of knowledge from the clans in the Iga and K≈çga regions that had been devoted to the training of ninja.[1] Bansensh≈´kai summarizes the main points of the three volumes of the original Ninjutsu book Kanrinseiy≈ç (ÈñìÊûóÊ∏ÖÈôΩ), and was written by selecting only those that fit the times. In the beginning of Bansensh≈´kai, the existence of the original text Kanrinseiy≈ç was mentioned, but its existence had not been confirmed for a long time. However, in June 2022, a manuscript of the second volume of Kanrinseiy≈ç copied in 1748 was found.[2][3]
It was compiled by Fujibayashi Yasutake in 1676, in the early years of the Tokugawa shogunate, to preserve the knowledge that had been developed during the near-constant military conflict from the ≈ånin War until the end of the Siege of Osaka almost 150 years later. As well as information on military strategy and weapons, it has sections on the astrological and philosophical beliefs of the times,[4] and along with the Sh≈çninki of 1681 and the Ninpiden of 1560 make up the three major sources[5] of direct information about this shadowy profession.
There is debate on whether it was written in Iga or Koga. Both regions used copies. But the consensus seems to be it was written in Iga based on the references to "a person in our region" being a person from Iga. Toward the end of the 18th century, representatives from Koga petitioned the shogunate for a stipend. Among the documents they provided to the government to make their case was a copy of the Bansenshukai. This copy is still in the National Diet Library.


Microcontrollers

ESP8266

 
The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip, with built-in TCP/IP networking software, and microcontroller capability, produced by Espressif Systems[1] in Shanghai, China.

The chip was popularized in the English-speaking maker community in August 2014 via the ESP-01 module, made by a third-party manufacturer Ai-Thinker. This small module allows microcontrollers to connect to a Wi-Fi network and make simple TCP/IP connections using Hayes-style commands. However, at first, there was almost no English-language documentation on the chip and the commands it accepted.[2] The very low price and the fact that there were very few external components on the module, which suggested that it could eventually be very inexpensive in volume, attracted many hackers to explore the module, the chip, and the software on it, as well as to translate the Chinese documentation.[3]
The ESP8285 is a similar chip with a built-in 1 MiB flash memory, allowing the design of single-chip devices capable of connecting via Wi-Fi.[4]
These microcontroller chips have been succeeded by the ESP32 family of devices.

Device performance and robustness are ensured by advanced core and peripherals made in a state-of-the art technology, a 16 MHz clock frequency, robust I/Os, independent watchdogs with separate clock source, and a clock security system.
The system cost is reduced thanks to an integrated true data EEPROM for up to 300 k write/erase cycles and a high system integration level with internal clock oscillators, watchdog and brown-out reset.
Full documentation is offered as well as a wide choice of development tools.







Software


Python
 
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

MicroPython
 
MicroPython is a software implementation of a programming language largely compatible with Python 3, written in C, that is optimized to run on a microcontroller.[2][3]
MicroPython consists of a Python compiler to bytecode and a runtime interpreter of that bytecode. The user is presented with an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute supported commands immediately. Included are a selection of core Python libraries; MicroPython includes modules which give the programmer access to low-level hardware.[4]
MicroPython does have an inline assembler, which lets the code run at full speed, but it is not portable across different microcontrollers.
The source code for the project is available on GitHub under the MIT License.[5]
A Casio FX-9860GIII calculator which was introduced in 2020, and came with built-in MicroPython
MicroPython was originally created by the Australian programmer Damien George, after a successful Kickstarter-backed campaign in 2013.[6] While the original Kickstarter campaign released MicroPython with an STM32F4-powered development board "pyboard", MicroPython supports a number of ARM based architectures.[7] The ports supported in the mainline are ARM Cortex-M (many STM32[8] boards, RP2040 boards, TI CC3200/WiPy, Teensy boards, Nordic nRF series, SAMD21 and SAMD51), ESP8266, ESP32,[9] 16-bit PIC, Unix, Windows, Zephyr, and JavaScript.[10] Also, there are many forks for a variety of systems and hardware platforms not supported in the mainline.[11]

Ubuntu
 
Ubuntu (/ äÀàb äntuÀê/ uu-BUUN-too)[8] is a Linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software.[9][10][11] Ubuntu is officially released in multiple editions: Desktop,[12] Server,[13] and Core[14] for Internet of things devices[15] and robots.[16][17] The operating system is developed by the British company Canonical,[18] and a community of other developers, under a meritocratic governance model.[8][19] As of October 2023, the most-recent release is 23.10 ("Mantic Minotaur"), and the current long-term support release is 22.04 ("Jammy Jellyfish").
As with other Linux distributions, all of the editions can run on a computer alone, or in a virtual machine. An upgrade to Ubuntu is released every six months, with long-term support (LTS) releases every two years.[8][20][21] Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release, starting from the release date until the release reaches its designated end-of-life (EOL) date.[8][22][23] Canonical generates revenue through the sale of premium services related to Ubuntu and donations from those who download the Ubuntu software.[24][25][26]
Ubuntu is named after the Nguni philosophy of ubuntu, "humanity to others" with a connotation of "I am what I am because of who we all are".[8] Since the release of the first version in 2004, Ubuntu has become one of the most popular Linux distributions for general purposes[27][28] and is backed by large online communities like Ask Ubuntu. Numerous community-editions of Ubuntu also exist.[29] It is also popular for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack.[30]


Parrot
 
Parrot Security (ParrotOS, Parrot) is a Free and Open source GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian Stable designed for security experts, developers and privacy aware people.
It includes a full portable arsenal for IT security and digital forensics operations. It also includes everything you need to develop your own programs or protect your privacy while surfing the net.
Parrot is available in three main editions, Security, Home and Architect Edition, even as Virtual Machine (Virtual Box, Parallels and VMware), on Raspberry Pi and also on Docker.
The operating system ships by default with MATE Desktop Environment, but it is possible to install others DEs.


Nmap
 
Nmap is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon. Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.


Wireshark
 
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet. Packet is the name given to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network.
Wireshark is the most often-used packet sniffer in the world. Like any other packet sniffer, Wireshark does three things:
Packet Capture: Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic ‚Äì quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time.
Filtering: Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just the information you need to see.
Visualization: Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.




Shodan
 
Shodan is a search engine for Internet-connected devices. Web search engines, such as Google and Bing, are great for finding websites. But what if you're interested in measuring which countries are becoming more connected? Or if you want to know which version of Microsoft IIS is the most popular? Or you want to find the control servers for malware? Maybe a new vulnerability came out and you want to see how many hosts it could affect? Traditional web search engines don't let you answer those questions.
Shodan gathers information about all devices directly connected to the Internet. If a device is directly hooked up to the Internet then Shodan queries it for various publicly-available information. The types of devices that are indexed can vary tremendously: ranging from small desktops up to nuclear power plants and everything in between.
So what does Shodan index then? The bulk of the data is taken from banners, which are metadata about a software that's running on a device. This can be information about the server software, what options the service supports, a welcome message or anything else that the client would like to know before interacting with the server. For example, following is a FTP banner:


Burpsuite
 
Whether you are a developer or a security professional, understanding how applications are attacked is the key to defending them. Burp Suite is an integrated platform and graphical tool for performing security testing of web applications, it supports the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.
Web Security Testing with Burp Suite
What is the use of Burp Suite? Burp Suite is an integrated platform/graphical tool for performing security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities. Burp Suite is installed by default in Kali Linux.
The tool is written in Java and developed by PortSwigger Web Security. The tool has three editions: a Community Edition that can be downloaded free of charge, a Professional Edition and an Enterprise Edition that can be purchased after a trial period. The Community edition has significantly reduced functionality. It intends to provide a comprehensive solution for web application security checks. In addition to basic functionality, such as proxy server, scanner and intruder, the tool also contains more advanced options such as a spider, a repeater, a decoder, a comparer, an extender and a sequencer.

Aircrack-ng
Aircrack-ng is a network software suite consisting of a detector, packet sniffer, WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK cracker and analysis tool for 802.11 wireless LANs. It works with any wireless network interface controller whose driver supports raw monitoring mode and can sniff 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g traffic. Packages are released for Linux and Windows.[2]
Aircrack-ng is a fork of the original Aircrack project. It can be found as a preinstalled tool in many security-focused Linux distributions such as Kali Linux or Parrot Security OS,[3] which share common attributes as they are developed under the same project (Debian).[4]
Development
Aircrack was originally developed by French security researcher Christophe Devine,[5] its main goal was to recover 802.11 wireless networks WEP keys using an implementation of the Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir (FMS) attack alongside the ones shared by a hacker named KoreK.[6][7][8]
Aircrack was forked by Thomas D'Otreppe in February 2006 and released as Aircrack-ng (Aircrack Next Generation).[9]

Support to enumerate users, password hashes, privileges, roles, databases, tables and columns.
Automatic recognition of password hash formats and support for cracking them using a dictionary-based attack.


John The Ripper
 
John the Ripper is a free password cracking software tool.[3] Originally developed for the Unix operating system, it can run on fifteen different platforms (eleven of which are architecture-specific versions of Unix, DOS, Win32, BeOS, and OpenVMS). It is among the most frequently used password testing and breaking programs[4] as it combines a number of password crackers into one package, autodetects password hash types, and includes a customizable cracker. It can be run against various encrypted password formats including several crypt password hash types most commonly found on various Unix versions (based on DES, MD5, or Blowfish), Kerberos AFS, and Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 LM hash. Additional modules have extended its ability to include MD4-based password hashes and passwords stored in LDAP, MySQL, and others.[5

Repository	github.com/hashcat/hashcat
Operating system	Cross-platform
Type	Password cracking
License	MIT License
Website	www.hashcat.net Edit this at WikidataHashcat is a password recovery tool. It had a proprietary code base until 2015, but was then released as open source software. Versions are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Examples of hashcat-supported hashing algorithms are LM hashes, MD4, MD5, SHA-family and Unix Crypt formats as well as algorithms used in MySQL and Cisco PIX.
Hashcat has been publicly noticed because of its optimizations; partly based on flaws in other software discovered by the creator of hashcat. An example was a flaw in 1Password's password manager hashing scheme.[1] It has also been compared to similar software in a Usenix publication[2] and been described on Ars technica.[3]

OSINT 
 
OSINT stands for open source intelligence gathering techniques


192.com (UK)
 
192.com keeps logs of all searches conducted by users of the Service (whether registered or not) including the IP (Internet Protocol) address from which a user session was conducted, the identity of the searcher (where we have it), the date and time of each search made and the results provided in response to a search.



Wigle.net
 
WiGLE (or Wireless Geographic Logging Engine) is a website for collecting information about the different wireless hotspots around the world. Users can register on the website and upload hotspot data like GPS coordinates, SSID, MAC address and the encryption type used on the hotspots discovered. In addition, cell tower data is uploaded and displayed.[1]
By obtaining information about the encryption of the different hotspots, WiGLE tries to create an awareness of the need for security by running a wireless network.[2]
The first recorded hotspot on WiGLE was uploaded in September 2001. By June 2017, WiGLE counted over 349 million recorded WiFi networks in its database, whereof 345 million was recorded with GPS coordinates and over 4.8 billion unique recorded observations. In addition, the database now contains 7.80 million unique cell towers including 7.75 million with GPS coordinates.[3] By May 2019, WiGLE had a total of 551 million networks recorded.[4]

Cloud C¬≤ C&C
 
A command-and-control [C&C] server is a computer controlled by an attacker or cybercriminal which is used to send commands to systems compromised by malware and receive stolen data from a target network. Many campaigns have been found using cloud-based services, such as webmail and file-sharing services, as C&C servers to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.
How C&C servers are used
C&C servers serve as command centers that malware related to targeted attacks use to store stolen data or download commands from. Establishing C&C communications is a vital step for attackers to move laterally inside a network.
C&C servers also serve as the headquarters for compromised machines in a botnet. It can be used to disseminate commands that can steal data, spread malware, disrupt web services, and more.  C&C systems used by botnets may follow any of these three models: the centralized model, the peer-to-peer [P2P] model, and the random model.
Malicious uses of a C&C server
C&C servers are the headquarters or command centers where malware related to targeted attacks report back to so  stolen data or download malicious commands can be stored. Establishing C&C communications is a vital step for attackers to move laterally inside a network.
C&C servers also serve as the headquarters for compromised machines in a botnet. It can be used to disseminate commands that can steal data, spread malware, disrupt web services, and more.  C&C systems used by botnets may follow any of these three models: the centralized model, the peer-to-peer [P2P] model, and the random model.

Aside from allowing attackers to steal data, the presence of C&C software on a server may also disrupt legitimate applications and cause the misuse of future resources.
